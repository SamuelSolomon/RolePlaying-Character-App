# RolePlaying-Character-App
This is a prototype of a Character Creation App for use in tabletop RPG's

## Functions
This app contains a Main Menu, a Character List view that conatains the a prototype character, and a tab bar view with three panels used to record character information. Currently only a protype character exists to be edited. This character can only be edited within the confines of the Character List view and the tab bar view. If you back out to the Main Menu any saved data will be lost.

## In regards to the Assignment
This is my first real assignment that required coding in Swift and my code reflects my lack of understanding. I began by using the Xcode Storyboard, which I regreted by the end. I feel I would have had an easier time if I had simply made the whole app without Storyboard. Trying to attach new code to something I had already made in storyboard was nuanced and difficult without first having a solid foundation in swift. In the end the way I structured my code didn't take particular advantage of Storyboards features. 
This was especcially apparent in regards to passing data, I opted to simply declare my variables within parent and sub classes and took care of the data handling manually. I plan to create somthing similar for my next project, though it will not be a direct continuation, and I feel I gained valuable insight to help me plan it properly.

## Changes currently dropped due to time constraints.
1. Better design and visual uniquness
2. the ability to create a new character and save it to the list
3. The ability to save the characters to the phone and load them into the app
4. More functionality and ease of use for documenting powers, skills, and Stats; systems that fall in line with the actual Hero System Tabletop RPG.
