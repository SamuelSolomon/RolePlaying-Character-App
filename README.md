# RolePlaying-Character-App
This is a Prototype of a Character Creation App for use in tabletop RPG's

# Functions
This App Contains a Main Menu, a list view of all the characters saved in the app, and a tab bar view of the three panels used to record information. Currently only a protype character exists to be edited, and can only be edited within the confines of the character list view and the tab bar panels. If you back out to the main menu the saved data will be lost, this is so that I can set up a system that saves and loads data to the actual phone when the list view is entered and exited.

# In regards to the Assignment
This is my first real assignment that required coding in Swift and my code reflects this. I began by using the Storyboard, which I found I regreted by the end, I wonder if i would have had an easier time if i had simply made the whole app without storyboard. Trying to attach new code to something I had already made in storyboard was complicated and difficult to identify all the nuances without first having a very strong foundation in swift. In the end the way I structured my code didn't take particular advantage of Segues in regards to passing data, I opted to simply declare my variables within parent and sub classes and take care of the data handling manually. I hope to create somthing similar for my next project, though it will not be a direct continuation, rather this was more a form of practice in setting up an app, and I feel I gained valuable insight in how to layout my next project.
